      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I was born in Lancaster, CA, just an hour from downtown Los Angeles. Up into middle school, I always told everybody who askecd that I was going to become an accountant. I had taken an affinity to mathematics and numbers, which still stays with me to this day.</p>
      <p>During high school, I had a variety of jobs. Whether it was a custodian, a ranch hand, or a maintencance man, I was dutiful and diligent in any task I perfomed. After graduation. I did everything from being a CPO to being a personal shopper. It wasn't until I learned of Web development that I knew I could make a career of it. </p>
